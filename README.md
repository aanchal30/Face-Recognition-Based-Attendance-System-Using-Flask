# Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System-Using-Flask

The task of the proposed system is to capture the face of each student and to store it in the database for their attendance. The face of the student needs to be captured in such a manner that all the feature of the students' face needs to be detected, even the seating and the posture of the student need to be recognized. There is no need for the teacher to manually take attendance in the class because the system records a video and through further processing steps the face is being recognized and the attendance database is updated. The proposed system is a face recognition-based attendance system that provides a more efficient, accurate, and secure way of tracking employee attendance. The system uses face recognition technology to identify employees and record their attendance in real-time.


#to implement this project
install all libraries that imported in code

Make folder name face recognition based attendance system inside that store app.py and then make 3 folders : 1]Attendance 2]Template 3]Static

1] attendance folder will automatically create CSV file of attendance with date
2] Inside Template Store Home.html 
3] Inside Static make one more folder name faces that will store live faces
now run app using flask run
